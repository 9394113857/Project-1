# Step 1: Ensure you're in the project directory
cd E:\Office-projects\dedee-projects\Registration-Flow

# Step 2: Check your current branches
git branch -a

# Step 3: Switch to the target branch where you want to merge (raghu)
git checkout raghu

# Step 4: Pull the latest updates (optional but good practice)
git pull origin raghu

# Step 5: Merge the 'experiments' branch into 'raghu'
git merge experiments

# Step 6: If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then:
# Add resolved files
git add .

# Finalize the merge after resolving conflicts (if any)
git commit -m "Merged experiments into raghu branch with UI and CRUD improvements"

# Step 7: Push the updated 'raghu' branch to the remote repository
git push origin raghu
